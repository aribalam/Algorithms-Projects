# Algorithms Projects

The repository contains practical applications using Data Structures and Algorithms
The applications are assignments to the Algorithms I and II course on Coursera.

## [WordNet](https://github.com/aribalam/Algorithms-Projects/tree/master/src/assignments/wordnet)

Creating a WordNet of nouns using graph data structure and measure the semantic relation between two sets of nouns using shortest ancestral path.

## [Seam Carving](https://github.com/aribalam/Algorithms-Projects/tree/master/src/assignments/seamcarving)

Implementation of Seam Carving algorithm using Topological Sorting. Seam Carving is a content aware resizing technique to reduce the image size by one pixel.

## [Baseball Elimination](https://github.com/aribalam/Algorithms-Projects/tree/master/src/assignments/baseballelimination)

Given the current standings of a baseball division, determine which teams has been mathematically eliminated using Ford Fulkerson's Maxflow algorithm.
